# ChatAndFeelBetterForPatients 
- We believe that there is a need for having an environment where Patients would share their feelings. A place where they feel very comfortable. In response to that, an ecosystem is being created where patients could meetup on regular basis, q&a with the doctors/nurses using chat application, forum and webinar session management.

## Delivered Product
- Fully functional Chat application which was being built using react framework with talk.js. This will be used to communicate with the doctor or nurses.
- Partially functional meetup application. This will be used to have meetups with all the members.
