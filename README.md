# ChatAndFeelBetterForPatients
We believe that there is a need for having an environment where Patients would share their feelings. A place where they feel very comfortable. In response to that, an ecosystem is being created where patients could meetup on regular basis, q&amp;a with the doctors/nurses using chat application, forum and webinar session management.
